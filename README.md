### About the Experiment 

Objective of synthesis of flip-flops:

1. to understand the basic concepts of flip-flops as elementary units of sequential circuits
2. to understand what is race around condition and why does it occur in JK flip-flop
3. to know how the race around condition which occures in JK flip-flop is avoided
4. to understand what kind of problems may occur in master slave JK flip-flop
5. to know the need for master slave JK flip-flop with asynchronous preset and clear
