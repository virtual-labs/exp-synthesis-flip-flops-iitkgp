### Objective



1. To understand the basic concepts of flip-flops as elementary units of sequential circuits
2. To understand what is race around condition and why does it occur in JK flip-flop
3. To know how the race around condition which occures in JK flip-flop is avoided
4. To understand what kind of problems may occur in master slave JK flip-flop
5. To know the need for master slave JK flip-flop with asynchronous preset and clear
